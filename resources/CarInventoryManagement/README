Proposed class design:

Parent class Vehicle
    subclass car
    subclass motorcycle
    subclass truck
Parent class Person
    subclass employees
    subclass customers

Class management needs to have a "sell car" method added

I'm thinking that vehicle database and person databases should be separate.

Class has been designed. Will probably need a few more methods. Still thinking

Deciding between making a Management class for all the methods in main.

================================================================================

Almost finished Car class. Added validation methods. Validation for 
constructor - ???

Created Management Class - This class manages the DB and only that. Not designed
for user interaction

Created Console Class - Designed for user interaction. Communicates with 
Management class to carry out tasks

Asg1 - Driver/Main/Runner what have you.

Lunch time :)
