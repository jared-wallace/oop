Class has been designed. Will probably need a few more methods. Still thinking

Deciding between making a Management class for all the methods in main.

Almost finished Car class. Added validation methods. Validation for 
constructor - ???

Created Management Class - This class manages the DB and only that. Not designed
for user interaction

Created Console Class - Designed for user interaction. Communicates with 
Management class to carry out tasks

Asg1 - Driver/Main/Runner what have you.

Lunch time :)
